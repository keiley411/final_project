## How I built the project
- used react,html/css for building front end components
- used express, sql, prisma, javascipt for building backend
- React router to route static pages with dynamics routes 
- styling components dynamically using Sass and css. 



## If I had more time I would change this
- deploy the project on Azure
- intergrate mpesa
- search feature to route to the specific product/ category
